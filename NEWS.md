bootImpute bootstraps then imputes each of the bootstrapped datasets multiple times. An analysis model can then be fitted to each imputed dataset, and inferences are made using an approach developed by von Hippel.

You can install the released version of bootImpute from CRAN with:
install.packages("bootImpute")

And the development version with
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jwb133/bootImpute")
