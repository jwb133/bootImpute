## R CMD check results
Notes that this a new submission and that the package was archived on 31 May for policy violation (see below).

Notes about possibly misspelled words (they are not mispelled).

Notes about finding the files ''NULL'' and 'lastMiKTeXException', which I have had before and understand are not an actual issue to be resolved.

## Additional comment regarding package archival
The package was removed yesterday (31 May) by Brian Ripley due to CRAN policy violations. A message was sent to maintainers of packages which depend on 'mice' (this one has it under Imports). I have moved institutions and I had not updated my contact email in DESCRIPTION file of the package. Brian received an auto-reply from my old address, which stated I had moved, was not checking the old address that often, and gave my new address. I am in fact still checking this old email daily, but wrote this in my auto-reply to encourage colleagues to update my email in their systems. In any case, I violated the policy not to keep an up to date contact email. My auto-reply also inadvertently violated two further policies - replying to Brian's personal email (due to me not setting up the email rule correctly, it turns out) and sending an email in HTML rather than plain text.

I sincerely apologise to the CRAN maintainers, and Brian in particular, for my policy violations. I am unsure whether the package being archived by Brian means it can never return to CRAN, or that it may be possible if I rectify the issue. As such, I am hereby submitting an updated version with my contact details updated, with the hope that the package may be allowed to return to CRAN.
