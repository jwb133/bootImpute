## Additional comment
The package was removed yesterday (31 May) by Brian Ripley due to CRAN policy violation. A message was sent to maintainers of packages which depend on 'mice' (this one has it under Imports). I have moved institutions and I had not updated my contact email in DESCRIPTION file of the package. Brian received an auto-reply from my old address, which stated I had moved and gave my new address. Contrary to the content of the auto-reply message, I am still checking this old email daily. In any case, I violated the policy not to keep an up to date contact email. My auto-reply also subsequently and inadvertently violated two further policies - replying to Brian's personal email (due to me not setting up the email rule correctly, it turns out) and sending an email in HTML rather than plain text.

I apologise to the CRAN maintainers for my error regarding updating my contact email. I am unsure whether the package being removed from CRAN by Brian means it can never return to CRAN, or that it may be possible if I rectify the issue. As such, I am hereby submitting an updated version with my contact details updated, with the hope that the package may be allowed to return to CRAN.
