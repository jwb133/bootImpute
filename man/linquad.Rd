\title{Simulated example data with continuous outcome and quadratic covariate effects}
\format{
A data frame with 1000 rows and 5 variables:
\describe{
  \item{y}{Continuous outcome}
  \item{z}{Fully observed covariate, with linear effect on outcome}
  \item{x}{Partially observed normally distributed covariate, with quadratic effect on outcome}
  \item{v}{An auxiliary variable (i.e. not contained in the substantive model)}
}
}
\usage{
linquad
}
\description{
A dataset containing simulated data where the outcome depends quadratically
on a partially observed covariate.
